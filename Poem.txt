The Life Poem

Life is a lot of things 
Filled with Memories
Emotions,Love, Pain ,Sacrifice
but you need to be patience enough 
To know when to act accordingly 
And not loose hope.
Beacuse at the end 
Life is a lot of things
Just wait for the next one to come.

And dont let anyone tell you 
what you are.
